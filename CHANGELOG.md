#### Fixes

- `FastProcessor` now correctly returns an error if the maximum number of cycles was exceeded during execution ([#2537](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2537)).
- `FastProcessor` now correctly only executes `trace` decorators when tracing is enabled (with `ExecutionOptions`) ([#2539](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2539)).

- System event errors now include the operation index, so diagnostics point to the exact emit instruction instead of the first operation in the basic block ([#2672](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2672)).
