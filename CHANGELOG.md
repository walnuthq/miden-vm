# Changelog

## v0.28.0 (unreleased)

#### Changes
- [BREAKING] Normalized each AIR's committed LogUp sum by its trace length and changed the running-sum constraint to close cyclically, removing the requirement that lookup activity be absent from the last row ([#3412](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3412)).
- `FastProcessor` `restore_call_state()` and `restore_context()` now return `OperationError::Internal` instead of panicking on empty stacks ([#3371](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3371), fixes [#3296](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3296)).

- Opened the `LargeSmtForest` backend API for external implementations: made `LineageMutation::new` and `AppliedLineageMutation::new` public and added `LineageId::as_bytes` and `MutationSet::from_parts`.
- Parallelized commitment buffer initialization and made the LMCS upsampling scratch buffer lazy ([#3406](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3406)).
- [BREAKING] Added `AdviceStack` as the public advice stack type. `AdviceInputs` and `AdviceProvider` now use it, and the old raw stack field and `extend_stack` helpers were removed ([#3423](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3423)).
- Sped up trace building: chiplets build in parallel, and on the sync proving paths the hasher chiplet builds during execution (on by default, `ExecutionOptions::with_overlapped_trace_build`) ([#3407](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3407)).
- Faster Poseidon2 hashing on aarch64 targets with SVE2 via an SVE2 kernel ([#3405](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3405)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed module and kernel metadata APIs from `ModuleInfo`/`Kernel` to `ModuleDescriptor`/`KernelDescriptor`, including matching module descriptor method names ([#3356](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3356)).
- Aligned workspace crate versions at `0.28.0`, except `midenc-hir-type`, so VM and crypto crates release as one version line.
- Imported the Miden crypto crates, benches, fuzz targets, and Wycheproof tests into this workspace ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- [BREAKING] Restored `AeadPoseidon2::key_from_bytes` to upstream canonical-Felt decoding. The SHA-256 KDF that briefly appeared on this branch is removed; keys persisted under the KDF contract must be re-derived ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Restored the `ExactSizeIterator` impl on `miden-serde-utils::ReadManyIter`, matching upstream, and corrected `size_hint` to advertise the exact remaining count ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Documented the `SharedSecret` zeroization contract on the k256 and x25519 ECDH paths: the type now holds owned `[u8; 32]` bytes and zeroizes on drop ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Hardened `Randomizable::from_random_bytes` to return `None` on short slices instead of panicking ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Capped `BudgetedReader::max_alloc` at `0` for zero-sized elements, so a length-prefixed `Vec<ZST>` can no longer claim `u64::MAX` elements (deliberate, documented divergence from upstream) ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Split package serialization assembly tests into their own module ([#3083](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3083)).
- Added the `miden-precompiles` crate with the official deferred precompile registry used by the VM/prover/verifier path ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated proof-bound precompiles to the deferred-DAG proof wire. `ExecutionProof` now carries a `DeferredStateWire`, proof serialization is incompatible with previous proof-bound precompile requests, and verification rehydrates the wire under the built-in `miden_precompiles::registry()` before binding the resulting deferred root to the STARK public inputs ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the legacy proof-bound precompile request/transcript model with the deferred-DAG framework in `miden_core::deferred`; the old request/transcript API has been removed in favor of `Node`, `Tag`, `DeferredState`, `DeferredStateWire`, `Precompile`, and `PrecompileRegistry` ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced precompile request count/calldata execution limits with deferred-state element budgeting. Use `ExecutionOptions::with_max_deferred_elements(...)` and `verify_with_max_deferred_elements(...)` for non-default deferred-state budgets ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the `miden::core::crypto::dsa::eddsa_ed25519` MASM module, Rust handler, docs, and tests. EdDSA support is temporarily removed from core-lib and will be reintroduced once it is supported by the precompiles prover ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the `miden::core::crypto::hashes::sha512` MASM module, Rust handler, docs, and tests. SHA-512 support is temporarily removed from core-lib and will be reintroduced once it is supported by the precompiles prover ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Changed the `miden::core::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_k256_keccak` advice/signature ABI to `QX[8] || QY[8] || SIG_R[8] || SIG_S[8]` as little-endian u32 field elements. Existing 65-byte signature advice must be re-encoded as `(r, s)` limbs without a recovery byte ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the public `miden::core::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_k256_keccak::verify_prehash` and raw `miden::precompiles::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_secp256k1::assert_verify_prehash` ECDSA prehash verifier entrypoints. ECDSA K256 Keccak verification is now exposed only through the high-level `verify` procedure, whose implementation inlines the verifier, loads signature scalars directly from advice, and avoids the raw prehash memory ABI ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Split Poseidon2 permutation rows out of `ChipletsAir` into `Poseidon2PermutationAir`, and updated the recursive verifier ACE registry for three AIRs ([#3345](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3345)).
- [BREAKING] Optimized the recursive verifier MASM by changing `fri_ext2fold4` to accept a natural coset index and return a loop-ready stack layout for FRI layer folding ([#3349](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3349)).
- [BREAKING] Add missing constraint in Bitwise chiplet ([#3386](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3386)).
- [BREAKING] Fixed a soundness gap in the chiplets AIR where a chiplet section's first-row initialization was skipped when the preceding section was empty. A program that uses memory but performs no `u32and`/`u32xor` operations produces an empty bitwise section, which caused the memory chiplet to skip its "values not being written must be zero" reset; a malicious prover could exploit this to forge a read of never-written memory. Each section's first row is now identified from the chiplet selectors at the boundary rather than from the previous chiplet's last row, so the initialization holds no matter which preceding sections are empty. The ACE section-start reset was hardened the same way as a precaution ([#3387](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3387)).
- [BREAKING] Optimize periodic columns evaluation for fewer ACE gates ([#3347](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3347)).
- Bound deferred precompile STARK proofs to the generated precompile ACE relation digest ([#3344](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3344)).
- Added the `miden-precompiles` crate with the official deferred precompile registry used by the VM/prover/verifier path.
- [BREAKING] Migrated proof-bound precompiles to the deferred-DAG proof wire. `ExecutionProof` now carries a `DeferredStateWire`, proof serialization is incompatible with previous proof-bound precompile requests, and verification rehydrates the wire under the built-in `miden_precompiles::registry()` before binding the resulting deferred root to the STARK public inputs.
- [BREAKING] Replaced the legacy proof-bound precompile request/transcript model with the deferred-DAG framework in `miden_core::deferred`; the old request/transcript API has been removed in favor of `Node`, `Tag`, `DeferredState`, `DeferredStateWire`, `Precompile`, and `PrecompileRegistry`.
- [BREAKING] Replaced precompile request count/calldata execution limits with deferred-state element budgeting. Use `ExecutionOptions::with_max_deferred_elements(...)` and `verify_with_max_deferred_elements(...)` for non-default deferred-state budgets.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `miden::core::crypto::dsa::eddsa_ed25519` MASM module, Rust handler, docs, and tests. EdDSA support is temporarily removed from core-lib and will be reintroduced once it is supported by the precompiles prover.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `miden::core::crypto::hashes::sha512` MASM module, Rust handler, docs, and tests. SHA-512 support is temporarily removed from core-lib and will be reintroduced once it is supported by the precompiles prover.
- [BREAKING] Changed the `miden::core::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_k256_keccak` advice/signature ABI to `QX[8] || QY[8] || SIG_R[8] || SIG_S[8]` as little-endian u32 field elements. Existing 65-byte signature advice must be re-encoded as `(r, s)` limbs without a recovery byte.
- [BREAKING] Removed the public `miden::core::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_k256_keccak::verify_prehash` and raw `miden::precompiles::crypto::dsa::ecdsa_secp256k1::assert_verify_prehash` ECDSA prehash verifier entrypoints. ECDSA K256 Keccak verification is now exposed only through the high-level `verify` procedure, whose implementation inlines the verifier, loads signature scalars directly from advice, and avoids the raw prehash memory ABI.
- Added the `miden-precompiles-prover` crate and integrated STARK-backed deferred precompile proofs into the standard proving and verification flow.
- Added partial deferred-proof APIs in `miden-prover` (`prove_partial`, `prove_partial_sync`, and `prove_partial_from_trace_sync`) and `Verifier::verify_partial`.
- [BREAKING] Reworked `ExecutionProof` into separate `StarkProof` and `DeferredProof` envelopes. The old public fields, `deferred_state()` and `stark_proof()` accessors, `into_parts()`, and three-argument `ExecutionProof::new` constructor were removed, and proof serialization changed.
- [BREAKING] Replaced the free `verify_with_max_deferred_elements` functions in `miden-verifier` and `miden-vm` with the configurable `Verifier` API. Use `Verifier::with_max_deferred_elements(...)` followed by `verify(...)` or `verify_partial(...)`.
- Added `Package::get_export_node()` and `Package::procedures_with_attribute()` APIs ([#3320](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3320)).
- [BREAKING] Add dead-node elimination in ACE DAG ([#3408](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3408)).
- [BREAKING] Removed unused public APIs and narrowed test-only helper visibility across VM and crypto crates ([#3424](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3424)).
- [BREAKING] Bump Plonky3 related dependencies to integrate SVE2 and WASM-SIMD128 speed-ups and include a NEON bugfix. ([#3441](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3441)).
- Bumped the imported crypto crates to 0.28.2 after the standalone crypto repository published different 0.28.1 package contents, and raised the minimum `p3-field` version to match `num-bigint` 0.5.

#### Fixes

- Demoted the `UntrustedMastForest` overspecification message (wire node hashes on a hashless-oriented path) from `error` to `debug`, so successful MAST deserialization no longer prints an `ERROR` line (fixes [#3425](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3425)).
- [BREAKING] Bound MMR peak commitments to the leaf count by hashing `[num_leaves, 0, 0, 0] || padded_peaks`, and updated the core library `mmr::pack`/`mmr::unpack` procedures to use the same preimage ([#3388](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3388)).
- Documented the program-entrypoint locals invariant on `Procedure::set_num_locals` and now assert it at that AST mutation site, so setting locals on an executable module's `begin`..`end` block panics at the producer boundary. The existing assembler assertion is retained as a backstop for entrypoints built directly via `Procedure::new` ([#3382](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3382)).
- Validated `SectionId` on deserialization: `Section::read_from()` now rejects invalid identifiers and the `serde` path delegates to `FromStr`, keeping both readers on the same invariant ([#3277](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3277)).
- Fixed `hash_elements_in_domain(&[], d)` colliding with `hash_elements_in_domain(&[ZERO; RATE_WIDTH], d)` for nonzero `d`, by absorbing a `ONE` padding marker on the empty-input branch ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Fixed `hash_bytes(&[])` returning `Word::default()`; the empty-bytes input now absorbs a padding marker and permutes, producing a nonzero digest consistent with the 10\* sponge padding rule ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Fixed a latent `CryptoBox` (IES) key-derivation bug: HKDF-SHA256 output is now reduced into canonical Felts via `AeadScheme::key_from_uniform_bytes` instead of being fed into canonical decoding, which rejected noncanonical limbs at ~2^-30 per key ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Hardened `AeadPoseidon2` and `XChaCha` decrypt paths against malleable ciphertexts by rejecting trailing bytes after a valid `EncryptedData` encoding ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Hardened Falcon signature deserialization against short buffers and rejected trailing bytes in `SignaturePoly::read_from_bytes` ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Fixed `ReadAdapter` buffer position not being reset when the local buffer drained to empty during `read_slice` ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Restored compact SMT serialization budgets so an empty-subtree-only `NodeValue` can be read under a tight budget ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Built the crypto SVE archive from target cfg (`CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH` / `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE`) instead of `#[cfg(target_feature = "sve")]`, which does not fire in build scripts ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Qualified the word-wrapper derive macro's emitted `String` as `alloc::string::String` and wrapped the impl in `const _: () = { extern crate alloc; ... }` for `no_std` and `#![no_implicit_prelude]` consumers ([#3366](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3366)).
- Fixed `miden-format` producing lines longer than the configured maximum for item imports; imports now wrap one item per line. Added `overflow_delimited_expr` to opt into keeping long `word(...)`/`event(...)` call heads on the assignment line when they fit ([#3380](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3380)).

## miden-vm v0.25.8 (2026-07-22)

- Fix validation of procedure names in package manifest exports when extracting module info
- [BREAKING] Consolidate all package debug info sections into `PackageDebugInfo`, and rewrite its serialization format to remove as much excess overhead as possible. This addresses the issue where the presence of package debug info causes massive execution-time overhead when requesting the debug info for the package. It also simplifies construction/maintenance of debug info, and provides more ergonomic APIs for accessing specific types of information. ([#3398](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3398))

## miden-vm v0.25.7 (2026-07-20)

- Use the `wincode` crate re-exported by `serde-wincode` for proof encoding.

## miden-vm v0.25.6 (2026-07-19)

- Update `wincode` dependency to v0.6.

## miden-vm v0.25.5 (2026-07-16)

- Use `Package::read_from_bytes_trusted` when loading preassembled packages from registry/cache during project assembly

## miden-vm v0.25.4 (2026-07-16)

- Add package post-processing hooks to the `ProjectSourceProvider` trait ([#3375](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3375)).
- Expose some assembler configuration methods, and `ProjectAssembler::assemble_source_project` ([#3383](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3383)).

## miden-vm v0.25.3 (2026-07-12)

- Update `wincode` dependency to v0.5.5.

## miden-vm v0.25.2 (2026-07-11)

- Support constructing initial `ResumeContext` for execution stepping from a `Package`, in order to ensure debug context is correctly initialized

## miden-vm v0.25.1 (2026-07-10)

- `ResumeContext` now makes the debug info it carries available to users beyond the `miden-processor` crate itself ([#3355](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3355))

## miden-vm v0.25.0 (2026-07-09)

#### Changes

- Added a Blake3 pure execution benchmark axis and reduced processor benchmark compile time by relaxing forced inlining in execution helpers ([#3289](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3289)).
- Documented that `smt::peek` is a fast, untrusted advice lookup, and that caller code must verify the returned value before relying on it ([#3297](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3297)).
- Clarified MAST node equality coverage by using structural `PartialEq` directly in merge tests ([#3298](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3298)).
- Documented the `sorted_array` lookup sortedness contract and added linear assertion helpers for proving word, key, and half-key ordering ([#3308](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3308)).
- Tightened LogUp lookup AIR docs and comments, removed unused operation-flag accessors, and added block-hash/op-group selector coverage ([#3309](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3309)).
- [BREAKING] Optimize constraint evaluation step by dropping redundant transition guards on op-flag-gated constraints ([#3319](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3319)).
- Fixed a panic (or silent miscompile in release builds) when assembling a procedure declaring more locals than the maximum representable during frame-pointer codegen; such procedures are now rejected with a diagnostic error ([#3332](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3332)).
- [BREAKING] Bound dense `MastForest` and package digests to stored roots, external dependencies, and advice, rejected non-canonical dense forest payloads, and moved dense forest construction to `DenseMastForestBuilder` ([#3334](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3334)).
- Made `make clippy` and `make lint` deny warnings so local linting fails on the same Clippy warnings as CI ([#3257](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3257)).
- [BREAKING] Optimize constraint evaluation step by merging one-hot gated stack op constraints ([#3333](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3333)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `MastForest::compact`; MAST construction should deduplicate through builders or explicit `MastForest::merge` calls instead ([#3318](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3318)).
- [BREAKING] Changed the ECDSA K256 Keccak public key commitment format to use affine public key coordinates (`qx_le_u32[8] || qy_le_u32[8]`) instead of compressed SEC1 public key bytes, aligning the core wrapper with the `miden-crypto` commitment format discussed in [0xMiden/crypto#1075](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/issues/1075). Existing public key commitments must be regenerated with `PublicKey::to_commitment()` ([#3342](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3342)).

## miden-crypto v0.28.0 (2026-07-03)

- Added a zeroizing read helper for deserializing sensitive material, fixing secret-key read buffers that were not wiped on error paths (ECDSA) or at all (Falcon, Poseidon2 AEAD) ([#1057](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1057)).
- [BREAKING] Rename miden-lifted-stark `parallel` feature to `concurrent` and make it a default one ([#1073](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/issues/1073)).
- Parallelize aux trace building for faster proving ([#1074](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/issues/1074)).
- [BREAKING] Changed ECDSA-k256 public-key commitments to hash native affine-coordinate limbs (`qx || qy`, little-endian `u32` limbs) while keeping compressed SEC1 serialization unchanged ([#1075](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/issues/1075)).
- Fixed SMT leaf advice decoding by rebuilding decoded entries through `SmtLeaf::new`, so decoded entries must match the supplied leaf index ([#1076](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1076)).
- Made `Felt::from_{u8, u16, u32}` const and added `Felt::MAX` ([#1081](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1081)).

## miden-vm v0.24.2 (2026-07-01)

- Reduced optimized benchmark build time by relaxing forced inlining in processor execution helpers ([#3292](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3292)).
- Added no-op handlers for readonly debugger events to `CoreLibrary::handlers`, so hosts that load the core library can execute programs emitting those events without registering no-op handlers manually ([#3305](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3305)).
- Added trusted sparse MAST forest serialization for trace replay payloads ([#3313](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3313)).

## miden-vm v0.24.0 (2026-06-24)

#### Enhancements

- Brought the core-lib `u256` module to full parity with the `u64` and `u128` modules ([#3167](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3167)).
- Added an event-based `miden::core::debug` module providing `print_*` procedures for print-style debugging of the operand stack, memory, advice stack, and advice map ([#3169](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3169)).
- Added `miden::core::debug::print_mem_addr` for printing a single memory cell (combine with `locaddr` to print a procedure local) ([#3203](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/3203)).
- Exposed a new parser function for parsing inline MASM blocks as CST or AST. ([#3211](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3211)).
- Project assembly can now be extended with support for source languages other than MASM via `ProjectSourceProvider` implementations ([#3216](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3216)).
- Added enum and `u256` records to `.debug_types` metadata so debuggers can preserve those type identities ([#3227](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3227)).
- Added `do <block> while <cond> end` syntax ([#3232](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3232)).

#### Changes

- Aligned replay stack word access bounds with `StackInterface`, allowing the maximum valid start index for word reads and writes ([#3014](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3014)).
- [BREAKING] Split the execution AIR into Core + Chiplets AIRs ([#3115](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3115)).
- Improved performances of auxiliary trace generation ([#3119](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3119)).
- [BREAKING] Simplified `MastForestBuilder` around builder-local refs and immutable finalized `MastForest`s ([#3139](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3139)).
- [BREAKING] Enabled `clippy::unnecessary_wraps` lint and removed all unnecessary `Option`/`Result` wrappings across the workspace ([#3143](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3143)).
- [BREAKING] Complete adapting trace generation to row-major ([#3171](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3171)).
- [BREAKING] Changed semantics of `LoopNode` to unconditionally enter loops ([#3187](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3187)).
- [BREAKING] Unified `OnceLockCompat` behavior across `std` and `no_std` ([#3188](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3188)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `prettier::pretty_print_csv`, `MastNodeId::from_usize_safe`, `DecoratorId::from_u32_bounded`, `OpBatch::end_indices`, — unused private API ([#3197](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3197)).
- Added a `RELEASE_PROCEDURE` file ([#3199](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3199)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `debug.*` decorators in favor of `miden::core::debug` procedures, and bumped the MAST wire format to `0.0.4` ([#3201](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3201)).
- [BREAKING] Cleaned up `Processor` trait by moving methods into their corresponding sub-interface ([#3202](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3202)).
- [BREAKING] Removed MASM `trace` decorators, remaining decorator execution scaffolding, the CLI `--trace` flag, trace-specific processor and host APIs, and decorator wire slots from the unreleased MAST format `0.0.4` ([#3208](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3208)).
- [BREAKING] Targets specified in `miden-project.toml` must now always provide a `path` key, though it may refer to files with extensions other than `.masm`, such as the case in Rust projects ([#3216](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3216))
- [BREAKING] `ProjectAssembler::assemble_with_sources` has been removed - projects require assembly from the filesystem going forward ([#3216](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3216)).
- Improved O(n²) to O(log n) name conflict checks in `Module::define_*` methods by introducing a `BTreeMap` name index; also narrowed `items_mut()` to return an iterator instead of `&mut Vec<Export>` to preserve the index invariant ([#3218](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3218)).
- [BREAKING] Imports in MASM may no longer refer to other imports in scope. Imports are now resolved in the global namespace (i.e. as if the path is absolute). The sole exception to this are imports which are submodule-relative - these now require an explicit `self::` prefix to tell the assembler that these should be resolved relative to a specific submodule. See ([#3220](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3220)).or `use {item1, item2 as alias} from some::module`, and may have `pub` visibility. See ([#3220](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3220)).
- [BREAKING] Re-exports in MASM (i.e. `pub use ...`) may no longer re-export modules. Normal imports (i.e. `use ...`) are not affected by this change. See ([#3220](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3220)).
- [BREAKING] `miden-vm bundle` now treats the `--kernel` option as a flag; when set, it expects the file path given to `bundle` to be the path to the root module of the kernel, and the support library for the kernel is derived from explicit submodule declarations in that module.
- [BREAKING] Assert the outer-LogUp boundary in MASM & restructure kernel public inputs ([#3256](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3256)).
- Reordered the chiplets trace columns and renamed the chiplet selectors to `s_00`/`s_01` ([#3266](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3266)).
- [BREAKING] Miden Assembly module structure must now be explicitly declared via `mod name`/`pub mod name`. The assembler will now ensure that only modules declared in this way are included in an artifact. For more details, see ([#3220](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3220)).
- Removed the legacy LALRPOP parser backend.
- [BREAKING] `Assembler::compile_and_statically_link_from_dir` is now `Assembler::compile_and_statically_link_from_root`, this is related to the change to MASM module structure mentioned above.
- [BREAKING] Moved debug info ownership out of `MastForest` and into package debug sections, adding source-node debug metadata that preserves distinct source occurrences after MAST node deduplication ([#3221](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3221)).
- Bounded `FastProcessor` memory growth with a configurable `ExecutionOptions::max_memory_elements` limit, rejecting writes to arbitrarily many unique addresses that could otherwise exhaust host memory ([#3226](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3226)).
- [BREAKING] Update `miden-crypto` and `miden-lifted-stark` dependencies to v0.26 ([#3228](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3228)).
- Cleaned up processor error handling for diagnostics, malformed MAST loading, and binary-value checks ([#3230](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3230)).
- [BREAKING] Import syntax in MASM has changed to be more explicit in distinguishing item vs module imports. Module imports are of the form `use some::module` or `use some::module as alias`, and may not have `pub` visibility; while item imports are of the form `use {item} from some::module` 
- Moved `proptest` test support behind optional features so `rand` 0.9 is not in the default dependency tree ([#3241](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3241)).
- Sped-up native verifier by skipping symbolic recomputation of constraint degree ([#3242](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3242)).
- Optimize Public Inputs absorption in recursive verifier ([#3243](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3243)).
- Reordered the chiplets trace columns and renamed the chiplet selectors to `s_00`/`s_01` ([#3266](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3266)).
- Bumped MSRV from 1.90 to 1.96 and replaced local `assert_matches!` macro with `core::assert_matches` ([#3267](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3267)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the stripped `MastForest` serialization mode. Normal forest bytes now describe execution data only ([#3268](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3268)).
- [BREAKING] Bump Plonky3 related dependencies to fix NEON arithmetic bug ([#3272](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3272)).
- [BREAKING] Bump Plonky3 and miden-crypto related dependencies ([#3275](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3275)).
- Imported `midenc-hir-type` as a released workspace crate.
- Added release tooling for publishing selected workspace crates.

- [BREAKING] Bounded advice Merkle store growth by internal node count during setup and execution ([#3264](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3264)).
- Fixed MASM tooling edge cases around atomic file writes, source URI paths, package loading, local registry state, diagnostics, generated MASM memory addresses, and CST `$...` special identifiers ([#3178](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3178)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the public `eddsa_ed25519::verify_prehash` entrypoint and bound EdDSA precompile verification to the signed message ([#3254](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3254)).
- Rejected SMT multi-leaf preimages with duplicate or unsorted keys before lookup or update logic runs ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3255)).
- Replaced `bincode` proof serialization with `wincode` and bounded verifier-side STARK proof deserialization to 64 MiB ([#3148](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3148)).
- [BREAKING] Made `miden-vm run` and `miden-vm prove` fail when the inferred `.inputs` file is missing ([#3236](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3236)).

- Upgraded `chacha20poly1305` to the current RustCrypto AEAD release line and added Wycheproof checks for ECDH and Ed25519 paths ([#1052](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1052)).
- [BREAKING] Bumped Plonky3 upstream dependencies to v0.6.0 ([#1053](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1053)).
- Use faster DFT algorithm for `PeriodicPolys` ([#1054](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1054)).

## miden-crypto v0.26.0 (2026-06-02)

- [BREAKING] Extracted `BackendReader`, allowing `LargeSmtForest<S>` to work with read-only storage backends ([#986](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/986)).
- Optimized prover quotient evaluation by evaluating each AIR's quotient on its native coset (size `n_j · D_j`) and lifting per-AIR, instead of always on the global maximum coset; constraint division is fused into the constraint evaluation loop ([#991](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/991)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the per-AIR witness/aux-builder proving model (`AirInstance`, `AirWitness`, `AuxBuilder`, `prove_multi` / `verify_multi`) with a `MultiAir` trait that owns its AIRs (each builds its own aux trace via `LiftedAir::build_aux_trace`), plus validated `Statement` / `ProverStatement` structs carried by `ProverInstance` / `VerifierInstance`. `LiftedAir::reduced_aux_values` and `num_var_len_public_inputs` are replaced by `MultiAir::eval_external`, which returns the cross-AIR external assertions as a flat list of extension-field values that must equal zero, fed by an `aux_inputs` slice whose schema each `MultiAir` owns and validates ([#992](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/992)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `miden-lifted-stark::domain` around a uniform `Coset` trait shared by `TwoAdicSubgroup` and `TwoAdicCoset`, slimmed the `LiftedDomain` surface (drops dead getters, removes silently-dispatched `points`/`bit_reversed_points`/`vanishing_at` in favour of explicit `trace_subgroup()` / `lde_coset()` access), made `LiftedDomain` constructors fallible, moved selector logic onto `LiftedDomain`, and changed `log_blowup` to return `u8` ([#993](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/993)).
- [BREAKING] Upgraded direct `rand` dependencies to 0.10, updating RNG trait bounds and removing direct `rand_hc` usage ([#995](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/995)).
- [BREAKING] Reorganized `miden-lifted-stark` internals: consolidated `align`, `bitrev`, `horner`, and `packing` helpers under a new `util` module; removed the legacy `fri::*` re-export facade ([#1000](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1000)).
- perf: fuse per-group accumulator and defer allocations ([#1008](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1008)).
- [BREAKING] Reduced `LargeSmt<S>` cache depth from 24 to 16 levels ([#1011](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1011)).
- [BREAKING] Implemented two-phase commit_mutations() / apply_mutations()-style API for `LargeSmtForest` ([#1018](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1018)).
- [BREAKING] Tightened the `miden-lifted-stark` public API surface: dropped the wide crate-root re-export list (callers now import from `miden_lifted_stark::air` and `miden_lifted_stark::{lmcs, pcs, proof, prover, verifier}` directly), demoted internal submodules to `pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`, and folded the `transcript` module into `proof` (`TranscriptChallenger` / `TranscriptData` / `TranscriptError` are re-exported there). Renamed the proof artifact types — `StarkProof` → `StarkProofData` (wire artifact) and `StarkTranscript` → `StarkProof` (parsed view, built via `StarkProof::from_data`) — and `*::from_verifier_channel` → `*::read_from_channel` on the PCS sub-proofs. Dropped the panicking domain constructors (`TwoAdicCoset::unshifted`, `LiftedDomain::{canonical, sub_domain}`) in favour of the fallible `try_*` variants ([#1020](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1020)).
- [BREAKING] Added reusable preprocessed trace setup artifacts for Lifted STARKs: AIRs can declare fixed preprocessed columns, provers build and reuse a `Preprocessed` commitment bundle, and verifier instances receive the trusted preprocessed commitment ([#1021](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1021)).
- [BREAKING] Fixed RocksDB CLI safety, non-canonical serde input handling, and qualified `WordWrapper` derive paths ([#1022](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1022)).
- [BREAKING] Simplify `LargeSmtForest` backend API ([#1030](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1030)).
- [BREAKING] Made `LargeSmt` leaf/entry/inner node iterators fallible ([#1032](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1032)).

- Fixed `miden-lifted-stark` builds when `p3-maybe-rayon/parallel` is enabled without `miden-lifted-stark/parallel` ([#1023](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/1023)).

## miden-vm v0.23.1 (2026-05-20)

- Restored metadata-neutral MAST node identity so public procedure roots do not depend on debug/decorator metadata shape; this reopens debug metadata precision issues from #2955 and #3054.

## miden-vm v0.23.0 (2026-05-09)

#### Features

- Added the `miden-vm-synthetic-bench` crate for VM-level proving regression detection driven by row-count snapshots from an external producer ([#3024](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3024)).
- Implemented the `miden-registry` tool for managing a local filesystem-based package registry. This is intended to help us explore what package management in Miden projects might look like with a central registry for sharing packages, without needing to go all-in on implementing one. [#2881](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2881).
- Introduce `SparseMastForest`, and use it to shrink the size of `TraceGenerationContext` [#3105](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3105).

- Return typed cycle errors for self-recursive and rootless procedure call graphs, and roll back linker state on failure ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2899)).
- [BREAKING] Reject oversized modules at resolver construction instead of building partial resolver state or panicking ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2899)).
- Return a normal assembly error when `pub use <digest> -> <name>` does not resolve to an exported procedure ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2899)).
- [BREAKING] Reject non-procedure invoke targets during semantic analysis, and return an assembly error instead of panicking if one still reaches assembly ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2899)).
- Rejected non-syscall references to exported kernel procedures in the linker ([#2902](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/2902)).
- Added `Package::content_digest()` to identify package contents without changing the MAST digest, including manifest data and semantic package metadata ([#2909](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2909)).
- Fixed `FastProcessor` so `after_exit` trace decorators execute when tracing is enabled without debug mode, and added a tracing-only regression test.
- Fixed the release dry-run publish cycle between `miden-air` and `miden-ace-codegen`, and preserved leaf-only DAG imports with explicit snapshots ([#2931](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2931)).
- Library deserialization now rejects exports whose `MastNodeId` is not a procedure root, closing a silent-failure path ([#2933](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2933)).
- Replaced unsound `ptr::read` with safe unbox in panic recovery, removing UB from potential double-drop ([#2934](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2934)).
- Fixed debug-only underflow in memory range-check trace generation when the first memory access is at `clk = 0` ([#2976](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2976)).
- Reverted the `MainTrace` typed row storage change that caused a large `blake3_1to1` trace-building regression ([#2949](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2949)).
- Fixed Falcon `mod_12289` remainder validation and `u64::rotr` overflow handling for rotations by `0` and `32` ([#2968](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2968)).
- Hardened SHA256 message word range checks and U32ADD/U32ADD3 carry constraints, updating recursive verifier relation digest artifacts ([#3021](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3021)).
- [BREAKING] Removed internal `_impl` precompile helpers from the core-lib API, hardened proof deserialization and debug storage errors, and added u256 regression vectors ([#3026](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3026)).
- Fixed `u256::wrapping_mul` so it preserves caller stack values below its operands ([#3071](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3071)).
- Fixed host event and advice-mutation diagnostics to point to the triggering `emit.event(...)` instruction ([#3042](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3042)).

- Fixed same-digest procedure selection so static linking and library-to-executable package conversion preserve the selected procedure's debug metadata ([#3054](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3054)).
- Canonicalized `PathBuf::try_from(String)` to match `TryFrom<&str>`/`FromStr`, so semantically equivalent quoted path components compare and hash consistently.
- Fixed `u256::wrapping_mul` so it preserves caller stack values below its operands ([#3071](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3071)).
- Rejected empty kernel packages before linking so malformed dependency metadata returns a structured package error instead of reaching the linker's non-empty-kernel assertion ([#3082](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3082)).
- [BREAKING] Bounded the live advice map by total field elements during execution; advice-provider setup now returns an error when initial advice exceeds this limit ([#3085](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3085)).
- Fixed `FastProcessor` stack growth so operand stack depth is bounded by `ExecutionOptions::max_stack_depth` instead of the internal buffer size ([#3086](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3086)).
- Hardened MAST forest and package byte-slice deserialization against fuzzed length fields ([#3088](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3088)).
- [BREAKING] Fixed project artifact reuse to ignore unrelated manifest fields, rejected private cross-module imports, and kept signature-only type imports live ([#3091](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3091)).
- Rejected private type references in exported procedure signatures, including transitive aliases and same-module absolute paths ([#3273](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3273)).
- Fixed stale `ReplayProcessor` doc comment links to `ExecutionTracer` after module-structure refactors.

- [BREAKING] Removed the deprecated `FastProcessor::execute_sync_mut()` alias; `execute_mut_sync()` is now the only sync mutable-execution entrypoint ([#2865](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2865)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the deprecated `FastProcessor::execute_for_trace_sync()` and `execute_for_trace()` wrappers; use `execute_trace_inputs_sync()` or `execute_trace_inputs()` instead ([#2865](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2865)).

- [BREAKING] Changed `SmtLeaf::hash` to perform domain-separated hashing, reducing the risk of a collision with the hash of an inner node. ([#962](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/962)).
- [BREAKING] Extracted `SmtStorageReader` and `SparseMerkleTreeReader`, allowing `LargeSmt<S>` to work with read-only storage backends ([#967](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/967)).
- Added domain-separated hashing support for elements to `AlgebraicSpoonge` as `hash_elements_in_domain(...)` ([#978](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/978)).

## miden-vm v0.22.3 (2026-05-01)

- Change value of `Path::MAX_COMPONENT_LENGTH` to `u16::MAX - 2` [#3087](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3087)

## miden-vm v0.22.2 (2026-04-28)

- Improve debug var loc tracking ([#2955](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2955)).

## miden-crypto v0.24.0 (2026-04-19)

- [BREAKING] Removed `AlgebraicSponge::merge_with_int()` method ([#894](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/894)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `Poseidon2` instance to match Plonky3 one ([#905](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/905)).
- Added `LargeSmtForest::add_lineages` which provides an efficient means of adding multiple new lineages at once ([#910](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/910)).
- Added the ability to configure the sync-to-disk behavior of the persistent backend using its config ([#912](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/912)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `WORD_SIZE_FELTS` and `WORD_SIZE_BYTES` from `miden-field` in favor of `Word::NUM_ELEMENTS` and `Word::SERIALIZED_SIZE`, respectively. The values remain the same ([#917](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/917)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `WORD_SIZE` from `miden-crypto` in favor of `Word::NUM_ELEMENTS`. Clients will need to update references to the constant, but `Word` will already be in scope as it is re-exported from `miden-crypto` ([#917](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/917)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `LexicographicWord` as `Word` itself now implements the correct comparison behavior. Any place where the former is used should be able to seamlessly swap to the latter ([#918](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/918)).
- [BREAKING] Removed implementations of `Deref` and `DerefMut` for `Felt` ([#919](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/919)).
- Added `Serializable` and `Deserializable` instances for `Arc<str>` ([#920](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/920)).
- Optimized batch inversion to use per-chunk scratch space ([#933](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/933)).
- [BREAKING] Changed the signature of `Felt::new` to perform reduction, and raise an error if the input is invalid. Retained the old behavior as `Felt::new_unchecked`, as its usage may lead to incorrect results ([#924](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/924)).
- Optimized field operations for `Goldilocks` ([#926](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/926)).
- [BREAKING] Moved per-instance log trace heights from `AirInstance` into `StarkProof`; `prove_multi` / `verify_multi` now observe them into the Fiat-Shamir challenger internally ([#956](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/956)). Consumers on the temporary `(log_trace_height, proof)` serialization path must drop the wrapper and stop pre-observing the height, or it will be bound twice. `StarkProof` no longer exposes per-instance heights directly — parse the proof with `StarkTranscript::from_proof` to read them; `num_traces()` is available for the count.
- [BREAKING] `prove_multi` / `verify_multi` no longer require instances in ascending trace-height order; the prover sorts internally and the proof carries an `air_order` permutation ([#941](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/issues/941)). `InstanceShapes::from_trace_heights` now sorts internally and embeds the AIR ordering. `InstanceShapes::observe` renamed to `observe_heights`. The `NotAscending` error variant is removed; `InvalidAirOrder` and `AirOrderLengthMismatch` are added. `AirWitness` now derives `Clone + Copy`. Callers must bind AIR configurations and `air_order` into the Fiat-Shamir challenger — see the prover module-level docs.
- [BREAKING] Split the `SecretKey` type for both ECDSA-k256 and EdDSA-25519 into `SigningKey` and `KeyExchangeKey` to help enforce better practices around key reuse. `SecretKey` is no longer available in the public API; all usages should be moved to one of the new key types ([#965](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/965)).
- Reduce repeated history scans in historical `LargeSmtForest::open()` queries ([#971](https://github.com/0xMiden/crypto/pull/971)).

## miden-vm v0.22.1 (2026-04-07)

- Implemented project assembly ([#2877](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2877)).
- Added `FastProcessor::into_parts()` to extract advice provider, memory, and precompile transcript after step-based execution ([#2901](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2901)).

- Introduced `build_trace_with_max_len()` which stops building the trace after a given max, and `build_trace()` no longer allocates more than 2^29 rows ([#2809](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2809)).
- `DebugHandler`'s default method implementations are now no-ops (instead of prints) ([#2837](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2837)).
- Added `ExecutionTrace::check_constraints()` for fast debug constraint checking without STARK proving, and migrated tests from `prove_and_verify` ([#2846](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2846)).
