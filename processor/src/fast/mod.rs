/// The initial size of the stack buffer.
///
/// Note: This value is much larger than it needs to be for the majority of programs. However, some
/// existing programs need it, so we're forced to push it up (though this should be double-checked).
/// At this high a value, we're starting to see some performance degradation on benchmarks. For
/// example, the blake3 benchmark went from 285 MHz to 250 MHz (~10% degradation). Perhaps a better
/// solution would be to make this value much smaller (~1000), and then fallback to a `Vec` if the
/// stack overflows.
const INITIAL_STACK_BUFFER_SIZE: usize = 6850;

/// The initial position of the top of the stack in the stack buffer.
///
/// We place this value close to 0 because if a program hits the limit, it's much more likely to hit
/// the upper bound than the lower bound, since hitting the lower bound only occurs when you drop
/// 0's that were generated automatically to keep the stack depth at 16. In practice, if this
/// occurs, it is most likely a bug.
const INITIAL_STACK_TOP_IDX: usize = 250;

/// Default maximum operand stack depth preserving the previous fixed-buffer ceiling.
const DEFAULT_MAX_STACK_DEPTH: usize =
    INITIAL_STACK_BUFFER_SIZE - INITIAL_STACK_TOP_IDX - 1 + MIN_STACK_DEPTH;

// FAST PROCESSOR
// ================================================================================================

/// A fast processor which doesn't generate any trace.
///
/// This processor is designed to be as fast as possible. Hence, it only keeps track of the current
/// state of the processor (i.e. the stack, current clock cycle, current memory context, and free
/// memory pointer).
///
/// # Stack Management
/// A few key points about how the stack was designed for maximum performance:
///
/// - The stack starts with a fixed buffer size defined by `INITIAL_STACK_BUFFER_SIZE`.
///     - This was observed to increase performance by at least 2x compared to using a `Vec` with
///       `push()` & `pop()`.
///     - We track the stack top and bottom using indices `stack_top_idx` and `stack_bot_idx`,
///       respectively.
/// - Since we are using a fixed-size buffer, we need to ensure that stack buffer accesses are not
///   out of bounds. Naively, we could check for this on every access. However, every operation
///   alters the stack depth by a predetermined amount, allowing us to precisely determine the
///   minimum number of operations required to reach a stack buffer boundary, whether at the top or
///   bottom.
///     - For example, if the stack top is 10 elements away from the top boundary, and the stack
///       bottom is 15 elements away from the bottom boundary, then we can safely execute 10
///       operations that modify the stack depth with no bounds check.
/// - When switching contexts (e.g., during a call or syscall), all elements past the first 16 are
///   stored in `stack_overflow_save_stack`, and the stack is truncated to 16 elements. They will be
///   restored when returning from the call or syscall.
///
/// # Clock Cycle Management
/// - The clock cycle (`clk`) is managed in the same way as in `Process`. That is, it is incremented
///   by 1 for every row that `Process` adds to the main trace.
///     - It is important to do so because the clock cycle is used to determine the context ID for
///       new execution contexts when using `call` or `dyncall`.
